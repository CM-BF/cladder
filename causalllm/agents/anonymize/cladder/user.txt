Your task is to extract the abstraction of the following background+question paragraph and reasoning steps:

background+question: "{prompt}"

Reasoning steps: "{response}"


Transform events/entities into variable symbols, denoted in order as {symbol_1}, {symbol_2}, {symbol_3}, etc; where event exist to be 1, non-exist to be 0, like {symbol_1}=1, or {symbol_1}=0.
Outputs the following information:
1. Variable notations:
- the variable symbol, e.g., {symbol_1}.
- the original name of the symbol, e.g., sister.
- the description if the variable is true ({symbol_1}=1), e.g., have a sister.
- the description if the variable is false ({symbol_1}=0), e.g., does not have a sister.
2. Transformed background and question, just replace events/entities with variables.
3. Transformed reasoning steps, ignoring the original symbol assigments and replacing them with the new symbols.
