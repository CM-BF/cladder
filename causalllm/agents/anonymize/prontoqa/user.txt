Your task is to extract the abstraction of the following background+question paragraph and reasoning steps:

background+question: "{prompt}"

Reasoning steps: "{response}"


Transform all entities and adjectives into variable symbols, denoted in order as {symbol_1}, {symbol_2}, {symbol_3}, etc. Each symbol represent one thing, like an object, an attribute, an adj. etc. Do not include "not" in the symbol name, e.g., "not small" should be transformed to "not {symbol_1}". Also, do not include determiners like "all", "each", "every" and linking verbs like "be", "is", "are" in the symbol names.
Outputs the following information:
1. Variable notations:
- the variable symbol, e.g., {symbol_1}.
- the original name of the symbol, e.g., small/butterfly/segmented/six-legged.
2. Transformed background and question, just replace all entities and adjectives with variables.
3. Transformed reasoning steps with the new symbols.
