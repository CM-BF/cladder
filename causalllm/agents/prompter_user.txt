Given a causal graph, where each node in the graph is a specific task. The node's parents are the input information for this task. Now you need to provide descriptions for each task for different people to solve.

For example, if the causal graph is:

A, C -> B

Then, because it has three variables/tasks, you need to assign them to three experts to solve in a topology order. So we verbolize the A for one expert, B for one expert. Then we verbolize C with the results of A and B for another expert.

For this A,B -> C, the prompt should include placeholders/variables for the previous results {extracted_coefficients} and {function_forms} and require output some placeholder(s)/varaible(s) for future dependent tasks, e.g.:

"
System prompt: You are a [C task related] expert. [More related descriptions].
User prompt: Given the extracted coefficients: {extracted_coefficients},
and the estimated function forms: {function_forms},

please [descriptions of C]. Propose your CoT and think step by step. Finally, [order the agent to output/conclude several keys/variables one by one.]
"

where {extracted_coefficients} and {function_forms} are placeholders for the results from the previous A and B tasks, where the required outputs of A and B must include keys "extracted_coefficients" and "function_forms" at the end of the outputs. For example:

A's agent output:
"
[Reasoning steps for A]
Final outputs:
extracted_coefficients: c1=0.5, c2=0.3
"

Note that {extracted_coefficients} in C's prompt will be formated by the real values from A's output (here, "c1=0.5, c2=0.3"), so ensuring the output keys are consistent with the input keys in the dependent subtasks is important.

Please provide the descriptions according to the following causal graph:

Solution Causal Graph for Evaluating Hypothesis Validity in Causal Relationships

Part 1: Variables (Subtasks)

{nodes}

Note the X is the given input, do not need to be executed. And its corresponding placeholder is {X}.
Y should be explicitly considered, i.e., for node X, A, B, ..., Y, you need to generate prompts for A, B, ..., Y.

Part 2: Causal Edges Between Variables

{edges}

Please consider:
1. What are the inputs for each task?
2. What are the outputs for each task? Format? Do the key/variable names of the previous outputs match the input?
3. What CoT guidance should be provided for each subtask?

Please follow the following reasoning steps:
1. Propose a Chain of Thought (CoT) for this prompt generation job including reflections and self-corrections.
2. Follow the proposed CoT's steps explicitly step by step.
