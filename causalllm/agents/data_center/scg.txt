X: Input text sample; this variable contains a complete problem statement provided as a raw text string, including both the causal relationship description of a system and one hypothesis about its operational performance. It is given directly from the dataset and is in the string format.
extracted_entities: Structured entities extracted from the input text; this variable holds key pieces of information such as processing clusters, resource capacities, maintenance periods, interdependencies, and other system-related relationships derived using NLP techniques like dependency parsing, named entity recognition, and rule-based extraction. It is derived from X and formatted as a dictionary or JSON object mapping entity names to their attributes.
extracted_hypothesis: Isolated hypothesis statement; this variable extracts the precise claim or query from the input that questions the system’s capability, using linguistic patterns and keyword detection methods. It is predicted from X by identifying question-indicating phrases and is presented as a concise string.
system_constraints: Operational constraints and parameters; this variable compiles limitations, durations, capacities, probabilities, and other numerical or qualitative restrictions mentioned in the input text. It is obtained using domain-specific rules and constraint extraction algorithms from X, and its format is a structured list or dictionary with keys representing constraint type and associated values.
logical_reasoning: Causal and logical analysis structure; this variable integrates the information from extracted_entities, extracted_hypothesis, and system_constraints using formal logic, causal inference rules, and reasoning frameworks such as decision trees or simulation-based approaches. The prediction of this variable relies on applying domain knowledge and logical validation procedures, and it is formatted as a reasoning summary or a boolean decision tree.
Y: The final classification output and decision indicator; this variable applies decision rules on the outcomes from logical_reasoning to determine if the hypothesis is valid, considering whether all system requirements and constraints are met. It uses threshold criteria and simulation assessments to decide and is formatted as a string output “yes” or “no”.
