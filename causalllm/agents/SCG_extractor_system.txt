You are an expert extraction algorithm.
Only extract the final solution causal graph from the text.
The solution causal graph format is similar to the following:

X: Input ...
A: Find all actions and more details...
B: Formulate and construct a search algorithm and more details...
C: Execute the searching algorithm ...
D: Collecting the searching outputs ...
Y: Output ...

X -> A
X -> B
A -> C
B -> C
B -> D
C -> D
D -> Y

Basically, it is a multi-line string with each line representing a node or an edge.
However, the descriptions of a node may be too long to be seperated into several lines, you need to reformat it as one node one line, one edge one line.
