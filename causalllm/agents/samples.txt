Sample 4:
Input: "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Xevo has a direct effect on tijv and gyzp. Tijv has a direct effect on gyzp. Method 1: We look at how xevo correlates with gyzp case by case according to tijv. Method 2: We look directly at how xevo correlates with gyzp in general. To understand how xevo affects gyzp, is it more correct to use the Method 1 than Method 2?"
Output: no

Sample 5:
Input: "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Having a sister has a direct effect on tar deposit. Tar deposit has a direct effect on lung cancer. For people who do not have a sister, the probability of lung cancer is 30%. For people who have a sister, the probability of lung cancer is 43%. For people who have a sister, would it be more likely to see lung cancer if the person did not have a sister?"
Output: no

Sample 6:
Input: "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Xevo has a direct effect on tijv. Tijv has a direct effect on gyzp. We know that xevo causes not tijv, and we know that tijv causes not gyzp. Would an individual is gyzp if not xevo instead of xevo?"
Output: no

Sample 7:
Input: "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Smoking has a direct effect on effort and college admission. Effort has a direct effect on college admission. For nonsmokers and are lazy, the probability of college admission is 55%. For nonsmokers and are hard-working, the probability of college admission is 24%. For smokers and are lazy, the probability of college admission is 81%. For smokers and are hard-working, the probability of college admission is 59%. For nonsmokers, the probability of being hard-working is 2%. For smokers, the probability of being hard-working is 59%. If we disregard the mediation effect through effort, would smoking positively affect college admission?"
Output: yes

Sample 8:
Input: "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Zuph has a direct effect on jyka and glimx. Jyka has a direct effect on glimx. For those who are not zuph and are not jyka, the probability of glimx is 100%. For those who are not zuph and are jyka, the probability of glimx is 51%. For those who are zuph and are not jyka, the probability of glimx is 28%. For those who are zuph and are jyka, the probability of glimx is 60%. For those who are not zuph, the probability of jyka is 93%. For those who are zuph, the probability of jyka is 40%. Does zuph negatively affect glimx through jyka?"
Output: no

Sample 9:
Input: "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Drinking coffee has a direct effect on hospitalization status. Broken bones has a direct effect on hospitalization status. The overall probability of drinking coffee is 41%. For people who do not drink coffee and non-hospitalized individuals, the probability of broken bones is 93%. For people who do not drink coffee and hospitalized individuals, the probability of broken bones is 69%. For people who drink coffee and non-hospitalized individuals, the probability of broken bones is 93%. For people who drink coffee and hospitalized individuals, the probability of broken bones is 75%. If we look at hospitalized individuals, does the chance of broken bones increase when drinking coffee?"
Output: yes

Sample 10:
Input: "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Talent has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. Effort has a direct effect on elite institution admission status. For students accepted to elite institutions, the correlation between talent and being hard-working is -0.33. If we look at students accepted to elite institutions, does it mean that talent affects being hard-working?"
