Given the following scenario:

## Input components:
{input_components}

## Incorrect Output:
{wrong_output}

Please analyze the above and answer:
1. Provide detailed feedback for each input component about why it may cause the error, including potential misunderstandings, logical inconsistencies, or incorrect assumptions. The feedback should include at least one concrete examples to reproduce, explain the critical errors, and potential ways to fix it.
2. Identify which input component is primarily responsible for the incorrect output.
