Please provide the prompts of the agents according to the following causal graph:

Part 1: Variables

{nodes}

Note the X is the given input, do not need to be executed. And its corresponding placeholder is {X}.
Y should be explicitly considered, i.e., for node X, A, B, ..., Y, you need to generate prompts for A, B, ..., Y. Again, no prompts for X, since X is given.

Part 2: Causal Edges Between Variables

{edges}

Please consider:
1. What are the inputs for each node?
2. What is the output format of each node? Do the variable names of the parents match the input?
3. What extra guidances should be provided for each node?
4. Wrap variables with {} to indicate they are placeholders.
