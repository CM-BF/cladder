Given a causal graph, a node's parents are the input information for this node. Now you need to provide descriptions for each node for different agents to solve.

For example, if the causal graph is:

extracted_coefficients, function_forms -> full_equation

Then, because it has three variables, you need to assign them to three agent experts to solve in a topology order. So we verbolize the A for one expert, B for one expert. Then we verbolize C with the results of A and B for another expert.

For this extracted_coefficients, function_forms -> full_equation, the prompt should include placeholders/variables for the previous results {extracted_coefficients} and {function_forms} and require output some placeholder(s)/varaible(s) for future dependent tasks, e.g.:

"
System prompt: You are a [`full_equation` task related] expert. [More related descriptions].
User prompt: Given the `extracted_coefficients`="{extracted_coefficients}",
and the estimated `function_forms`="{function_forms}",

please [descriptions of the `full_equation` task].

Finally, please output the variable `full_equation` as:
full_equation: [the format of `full_equation`]
"

where {extracted_coefficients} and {function_forms} are placeholders for the results from the previous `extracted_coefficients` and `function_forms` nodes. For example:

`extracted_coefficients`'s agent output:
"
[Reasoning steps for the `extracted_coefficients` task]
Final output:
extracted_coefficients: c1=0.5, c2=0.3
"

Note that {extracted_coefficients} in `full_equation`'s prompt will be formated by the real values of `extracted_coefficients` (here, "c1=0.5, c2=0.3"), so ensuring input variables/placeholders are consistent with dependent variable names is important.

Please provide the descriptions according to the following causal graph:

Solution Causal Graph for Evaluating Hypothesis Validity in Causal Relationships

Part 1: Variables

{nodes}

Note the X is the given input, do not need to be executed. And its corresponding placeholder is {X}.
Y should be explicitly considered, i.e., for node X, A, B, ..., Y, you need to generate prompts for A, B, ..., Y.

Part 2: Causal Edges Between Variables

{edges}

Please consider:
1. What are the inputs for each node?
2. What is the output format of each node? Do the variable names of the parents match the input?
3. What extra guidances should be provided for each node?
4. Wrap variables with {} to indicate they are placeholders.
