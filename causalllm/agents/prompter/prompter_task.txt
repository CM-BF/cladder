The task is to generate prompts for structured causal functions in a causal graph.
For each node/variable, you need to generate two prompts for a LLM agent to act like a structured causal equation/function.
The first prompt is a system prompt, defining the role of the agent.
The second prompt is a task/function prompt, defining the procedure the agent needs to apply to obtain the node/variable.
