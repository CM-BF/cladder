## Solution causal graph (SCG) format

X: Input (one sample from a dataset)
A: Find all actions and more details including What tools/theorems/methods/rules to be used? What is(are) the output(s) of the subtask? (in one line, no line breakers)
B: Formulate and construct a search algorithm and more details...
C: Execute the searching algorithm ...
D: Collecting the searching outputs ...
Y: Output (brief descriptions)

X -> A
X -> B
A -> C
B -> C
B -> D
C -> D
D -> Y


You must list both node X (input) and Y (output), and their descriptions can be brief. Other nodes should have descriptions with 2+ sentences: Name of the subtask; What the subtask is about? What tools/theorems/methods/rules to be used? What is(are) the output(s) of the subtask?
One line one node including all the descriptions, one line one edge. No matter how long the descriptions are, the format should be strictly followed. No extra line breakers.

This shows the oversimplified solution causal graph. The real solution causal graph should include more details, more complex and dedicated connections.
The solution causal graph includes both node descriptions and edges. Everytime outputting a solution causal graph, you need to output both of them.
More variables/subtasks names? A-Z, AA-AZ, BA-BZ, ... or using more specific names.


## Task description

Provide a solution causal graph for the following task:

The task is to predict Y given X for a specific dataset.

This dataset is consist of many (X, Y) pairs, i.e., input-output pairs.
Input (X): causal relationship description + one hypothesis
Output (Y): Whether the hypothesis mentioned in X is valid or not. (yes/no)

To construct the solution causal graph, you need to consider using the samples in the dataset:

Sample 1:
Input: "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Rixq has a direct effect on zuph and xevu. Zuph has a direct effect on xevu. The overall probability of rixq is 83%. The probability of not rixq and xevu is 8%. The probability of rixq and xevu is 36%. Is the chance of xevu larger when observing rixq?"
Output: no

Sample 2:
Input: "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Encouragement level has a direct effect on studying habit and exam score. Studying habit has a direct effect on exam score. For students who are not encouraged, the probability of high exam score is 26%. For students who are encouraged, the probability of high exam score is 72%. Will encouragement decrease the chance of high exam score?"
Output: no

Sample 3:
Input: "Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Gwet has a direct effect on cwoi and yomx. Yomx has a direct effect on xevu. Cwoi has a direct effect on xevu. The overall probability of yomx is 20%. For those who are not yomx, the probability of xevu is 86%. For those who are yomx, the probability of xevu is 25%. Is xevu more likely than not xevu overall?"
Output: yes

## Command

Please output the solution causal graph for this task.

## Guidance

There are several important points you need to consider:
- The solution causal graph should be general not specific to an instance (sample). Therefore, the solution causal graph can be used to solve all samples in the dataset.
- At the end of your response, you must output the solution causal graph strictly following the solution causal graph format, including node descriptions and edges.
- One line one node, one line one edge. No matter how long the descriptions are.
