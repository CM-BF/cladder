## Solution causal graph (SCG) format example

X: (one sample from a dataset)
available_actions: more details including the description of `available_actions`; what tools/theorems/methods/rules are needed? The format of the output, e.g., a list of available actions. (in one line, no line breakers)
formulated_problem: more details...
searching_algorithm_formulation: more details, e.g., design a searching algorithm using the `available_actions` and `problem_formulation`...
searching_algorithm_code: more details, e.g., using python to implement...
search_result: more details, e.g., code execution environments; format of `search_result` should be a python code block; outputs for errors.
Y: (brief descriptions)

X -> available_actions
X -> formulated_problem
available_actions -> searching_algorithm_formulation
formulated_problem -> searching_algorithm_formulation
searching_algorithm_formulation -> searching_algorithm_code
searching_algorithm_code -> search_result
search_result -> Y

Please don't bias towards the variables in the example, the task you are working on is very different.

You must list both node X (input) and Y (output), and their descriptions can be brief. Other nodes should have descriptions with 2+ sentences: The description of the variable. How to predict this variable, including what tools/theorems/methods/rules are needed? The format of the variable.
One line one node including all the descriptions, one line one edge. No matter how long the descriptions are, the format should be strictly followed. No extra line breakers.

This shows the oversimplified solution causal graph. The real solution causal graph should include more details, more complex and dedicated connections.
The solution causal graph includes both node descriptions and edges. Everytime outputting a solution causal graph, you need to output both of them.


## Task description

Provide a solution causal graph for the following task:

The task is to predict Y given X for a specific dataset.

This dataset is consist of many (X, Y) pairs, i.e., input-output pairs.
Input (X): causal relationship description + one hypothesis
Output (Y): Whether the hypothesis mentioned in X is valid or not. (yes/no)

To construct the solution causal graph, you need to consider using the samples in the dataset:

{samples}

## Command

Please output the solution causal graph for this task.

## Guidance

There are several important points you need to consider:
- The solution causal graph should be general not specific to an instance (sample). Therefore, the solution causal graph can be used to solve all samples in the dataset.
- At the end of your response, you must output the solution causal graph strictly following the solution causal graph format, including node descriptions and edges.
- One line one node, one line one edge. No matter how long the descriptions are.
- The variable name should be an attribute/entities that have explicit formats instead of a process/procedure/function. Using `model`, `designed_graph`, `result`, `validity`, etc. Avoid `modeling`, `graph_design`, `calculation`, `check`, `analysis`, etc.
