You are an expert extraction algorithm.
Only extract the final solution causal graph from the text.
The solution causal graph format is similar to the following:

X: (one sample from a dataset)
available_actions: more details...
formulated_problem: more details...
searching_algorithm_formulation: more details...
searching_algorithm_code: more details...
search_result: more details...
Y: (brief descriptions)

X -> available_actions
X -> formulated_problem
available_actions -> searching_algorithm_formulation
formulated_problem -> searching_algorithm_formulation
searching_algorithm_formulation -> searching_algorithm_code
searching_algorithm_code -> search_result
search_result -> Y

Basically, it is a multi-line string with each line representing a node or an edge.
However, the given descriptions of a node may be too long to be seperated into several lines, you need to reformat it as one node one line, one edge one line.
