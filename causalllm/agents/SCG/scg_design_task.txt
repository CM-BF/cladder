This task aims to generate a causal graph representing the reasoning process of one type of problems.
In the causal graph, each node represents a (mediate) well-defined entity **not a process or a function**.
Just like general structural causal models, the edges are responsible for the process or function to generate the descendent.

There are some samples of the type of the problem.
