Your task is to propose a causal graph (like a flow chart) describing the ways to solve a specific task. We call this causal graph a solution causal graph (a DAG). The task can be math reasoning task, game 24, blocks world, and more.
Please output a solution causal graph as two parts.
part 1: Start/Intermediate/Final entities/variables, one variable one node. Each variable should be described in 2+ sentences. [What is the name of the variable? The description of the variable. How to predict this variable, including what tools/theorems/methods/rules are needed? The format of the variable.]
part 2: Causal edges between variables by considering the dependencies among variables. One edge per line.
