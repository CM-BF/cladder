Q: Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships: Rixq has a direct effect on zuph and xevu. Zuph has a direct effect on xevu. The overall probability of rixq is 83%. The probability of not rixq and xevu is 8%. The probability of rixq and xevu is 36%. Is the chance of xevu larger when observing rixq?

Guidance: Address the question by following the steps below:

Step 1) Extract the causal graph: Identify the causal graph that depicts the relationships in the scenario. Use "X" to represent "rixq". Use "V2" to represent "zuph". Use "Y" to represent "xevu". The diagram should simply consist of edges denoted in "var1 -> var2" format, separated by commas.

Step 2) Determine the query type: Identify the type of query implied by the main question. Choices include "marginal probability", "conditional probability", "explaining away effect", "backdoor adjustment set", "average treatment effect", "collider bias", "normal counterfactual question", "average treatment effect on treated", "natural direct effect" or "natural indirect effect". Your answer should only be a term from the list above, enclosed in quotation marks.

Step 3) Formalize the query: Translate the query into its formal mathematical expression based on its type, utilizing the "do(·)" notation or counterfactual notations as needed.

Step 4) Gather all relevant data: Extract all the available data. Your answer should contain nothing but marginal probabilities and conditional probabilities in the form "P(...)=..." or "P(...|...)=...", each probability being separated by a semicolon. Stick to the previously mentioned denotations for the variables.

Step 5) Deduce the estimand using causal inference: Given all the information above, deduce the estimand using skills such as do-calculus, counterfactual prediction, and the basics of probabilities. Answer step by step.

Step 6) Calculate the estimand: Insert the relevant data in Step 4 into the estimand, perform basic arithmetic calculations, and derive the final answer. There is an identifiable answer. Answer step by step.
A: Step 1) Extract the causal graph:
The causal graph based on the given scenario is:
X -> V2, X -> Y, V2 -> Y

Step 2) Determine the query type:
The type of query implied by the main question is "conditional probability".

Step 3) Formalize the query:
The formal mathematical expression for the query is P(Y | do(X)).

Step 4) Gather all relevant data:
We have the following probabilities:
P(X) = 0.83; P(~X ∧ Y) = 0.08; P(X ∧ Y) = 0.36

Step 5) Deduce the estimand using causal inference:
To find P(Y | do(X)), we need to use the do-calculus. Since X has a direct effect on Y and V2, and V2 also has a direct effect on Y, we need to block the backdoor path from X to Y through V2. However, since there are no confounders mentioned in the scenario, we can assume that P(Y | do(X)) is equivalent to P(Y | X).

We can calculate P(Y) using the Law of Total Probability:
P(Y) = P(Y | X)P(X) + P(Y | ~X)P(~X)

We already have P(X), P(X ∧ Y), and P(~X ∧ Y). We can calculate P(Y | X) and P(Y | ~X) using these probabilities.

Step 6) Calculate the estimand:
First, we calculate P(Y | X) and P(Y | ~X):

P(Y | X) = P(X ∧ Y) / P(X) = 0.36 / 0.83 ≈ 0.4337
P(Y | ~X) can be found by first finding P(~X), which is 1 - P(X) = 1 - 0.83 = 0.17. Then we use P(~X ∧ Y) to find P(Y | ~X):
P(Y | ~X) = P(~X ∧ Y) / P(~X) = 0.08 / 0.17 ≈ 0.4706

Now we can calculate P(Y):
P(Y) = P(Y | X)P(X) + P(Y | ~X)P(~X)
P(Y) = (0.4337)(0.83) + (0.4706)(0.17)
P(Y) ≈ (0.3600) + (0.0800)
P(Y) ≈ 0.44

Since P(Y | X) ≈ 0.4337 and P(Y) ≈ 0.44, the chance of Y (xevu) is slightly higher when not observing X (rixq) than when observing X, given the probabilities provided. Therefore, the answer to the main question is no, the chance of xevu is not larger when observing rixq; it is actually slightly smaller.
